# Visible infraestructura 
#### ***MIID course: ETL and data modeling - University of the Andes***

Infraestructura visible is an initiative of University of the Andes whose objective is to collect us ti recolect, analyse and centralize information of different government institutions about the current and future infrastructure of Colombia. [link to the project](https://www.infraestructuravisible.org/).

In this course I was tasked with consultant duties. The organization gave us data related with airports and flights from Colombia and they were hoping to solve a set of analytical requirements.
